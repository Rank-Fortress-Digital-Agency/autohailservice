          <h2>The First Steps in the Automotive Hail Repair Process</h2>
          <p>
            As the storm clouds fade and hail stones lay dormant after an epic
            battle with your vehicle; you step out to find what seems like a
            victory for Mother Nature. You should first take a quick inventory
            of the damages looking for things like broken glass, the relative
            size and quantity of dents in preparation for the important call to
            your auto insurance provider. Filing a hail damage claim soon after
            the storm ensures you get the most out of the claim and your car
            back looking as good as new in a matter of days.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lead time to repair auto hail damage depends greatly upon the
            repair shop and the extent of the damages. Be prepared to wait a few
            extra days if new glass, paint or a specific part has to be ordered.
            Step 2 on the road to your vehicle’s recovery is equally important
            to filing a claim; researching the paintless dent repair and hail
            repair shops in your area.
          </p>

            <div>
              <img
                style="height: 620px"
                src="https://assets.cdn.msgsndr.com/IqkAHwPrs3txEDNMaAl8/media/61c5f9ddd4708697aea717b8.png"
                alt="VIP Hail Service Plano, TX"
              />
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                When choosing a repair shop you should treat it similarly to
                purchasing a product online. Are you going to buy something with
                2 stars, 5 stars or purchase with blind faith by not looking at
                what other’s had to say? What if Amazon can get it to you
                tomorrow but Wal-Mart takes an extra 4 days?
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re like most, you’ll be reading the reviews and
                considering the time it takes to get the item to you. For
                reasons unknown, this logic isn’t always applied to services
                like automotive hail repair. Every shop in North Texas offers
                the same ‘great’ quality of service if you take their website’s
                word for it but I guarantee that your satisfaction with the
                outcome and the time it takes to repair will vary dramatically
                from one shop to the next.
              </p>
              <p>
                Spending 15 minutes to do a quick Google search of the business’
                name you’re considering to trust with your ride, can save you
                weeks without it and heartbreak when the repairs don’t live up
                to your standards. Searching their business name should result
                in a page full of their website(s), social media profiles,
                business listings, reviews and more. If the search result page
                is a little bare, shows a lot of other companies or their
                reviews are lacking, it may be a good idea to move on to your
                next option.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            You also shouldn’t choose any old body shop to complete the hail
            damage repair. It should be clear that the shop’s expertise and main
            service is
            <a href="https://viphailservice.com/paintless-dent-repair"
              >Paintless dent repair</a
            >, the industry standard for repairing automotive hail damages.
            These techniques allow for the dents to be removed without painting,
            using fillers or new body panels so the original parts are perfectly
            restored. This can save you $1000s and retain the vehicle’s value as
            PDR is usually not reported to CarFAX.

              <h2>What to Expect for Automotive Hail Damage Repairs</h2>
              <p>
                The right expectations can make all the difference in having an
                overall positive experience with the hail damage repair process.
                We understand this isn’t something anyone wants to deal with but
                going in with an understanding of the possible outcomes can
                remove unnecessary stress.
              </p>
              <p>
                In most hail damage claims there three typical outcomes after
                filing; your insurance allows you to choose a repair shop, they
                have a natural disaster site set up for local vehicle repairs,
                or the cost to repair can sometimes be greater than the value of
                older vehicles resulting in a check for a new one.

          <h2>More Tips on What to Do If your Vehicle Has Hail Damage</h2>
          <p>
            The more informed you are (about automotive hail repair and the
            paintless dent repair process) going in, the better your overall
            experience will be. As previously mentioned the first step is always
            filing a claim with your insurance and then researching reputable
            hail repair shops in your area. After reading reviews, checking out
            some photos and maybe their home page or social profiles, contact
            your shop of choice to share claim details and arrange getting the
            vehicle to the shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first scenario, choosing your own repair shop, the next step
            would be to do just that. Give them a call with the claim details
            and schedule a time to get the vehicle to the shop. Expert
            technicians will then complete a full body inspection documenting
            every imperfection, dent and ding on your vehicle. Their first goal
            being documentation for the purpose of submitting an estimate for
            repair to your insurance providers. (*VIP Hail Service uses industry
            leading technology to provide standardized pricing based around the
            size, shape and quantity of dents along with access to repair which
            also considers vehicle make and model.)
          </p>
          <p>
            After an estimate is approved the paintless dent removal process
            will begin, removing each dent to the vehicle body by pushing out
            with perfectly shaped rods or by using paint-safe glue and a tab to
            pull the dents out. Depending on how severe the damage is,
            (considering things like broken glass, paint damage, and large
            dents) you should expect your car to be in the shop for a few extra
            days. Be sure to always ask about how long the hail repairs will
            take, with VIP Hail service our average time is 5-7 days. If you’re
            expecting this level of urgency with every shop you may be let down
            and without a ride for a month or more.
          </p>
          <p>
            When certain areas are hit harder than others by a large hail storm
            some insurance companies will already have a disaster relief site
            running. In these cases you’ll be referred to the closest site when
            you file a claim. Going this route, the insurance company basically
            handles everything, they will have contracted paintless dent repair
            technicians on site repairing all of the damaged vehicles covered by
            the same provider. Depending on how many vehicles are in front of
            you, it could be a few weeks, so it’s important to file a claim
            quickly. It could be worth asking if you can hire your own hail
            repair shop as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third scenario is less common but it does happen from time to
            time. If your vehicle is an older model with sever hail damage the
            cost to repair it could be greater than the value of the vehicle.
            This seemingly unfortunate event can often turn out better for the
            owner by receiving a check that is more than the vehicle value, to
            purchase another one.

              "
            >
              <p>
                Once these details are worked out there are a few more helpful
                things you can do before the initial inspection takes place. One
                is having arrangements made for a rental, (*VIP Hail Service is
                located across the street from Enterprise) whether it’s through
                your insurance or set up with the repair shop.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this point you should be set on making phone calls and having
                everything scheduled for the hail damage repair. Now is the
                perfect time to continue learning about what to when your
